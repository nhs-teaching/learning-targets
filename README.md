How to run
==========
The analyzer script accesses a database called db.sqlite that uses the schema `SCHEMA.sql` in the backup directory. Use the `inputScores` script to insert data for students as well as the `loader` sql files to auto populate information from a csv format. 

The purpose of analyzer is to primarily create a visual representation of how students are growing over time.
